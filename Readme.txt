Just imagine, in an hypothetical tought, that you have a video file and a .srt file that are not sincronized..
Now... I'm not saying that is an illegal pirated movie or anything, it's all purely hypothetical.
Well... You just type the time that the dialog starts and then you load the subtitle and it changes the time value
from each line.
Remember... Its just for fun!!...
